 * BulletHandler
 * 
 * Handles the general activities of bullets. This class is to bullets as BasicBulletHandler is to BasicBullet.
 * Amusedly, it currently has no more functionality than the abstract handler.  Which is fine by me.
 * Most likely, I will have to add some more functionality later, but I am happy for now.
